Analysis of Stroop Effect
The Stroop effect is the finding that naming the colors of color words (e.g. the words 'green', 'red', 'blue', etc.) is easier 
and quicker if the actual observed colors of the words match the colors that the words denote (e.g. the colors green, red,
blue, etc., respectively) than if they do not match.

Ansered the following :

1) Question response correctly identifies the independent and dependent variables in the experiment.

2a) Null and alternative hypotheses are clearly stated in words and mathematically

2b) A Statistical test is proposed which will distinguish the proposed hypotheses

3) Descriptive statistics, including at least one measure of centrality and one measure of variability, have been computed for the datasetâ€™s groups.

4) One or two visualizations have been created that show off the data, including comments on what can be observed in the plot or plots.

5) A statistical test has been correctly performed and reported, including test statistic, p-value, and test result. 
The test results are interpreted in terms of the experimental task performed.

6) Hypotheses regarding the reasons for the effect observed are presented. An extension or related experiment to the performed 
Stroop task is provided, that may produce similar effects.
